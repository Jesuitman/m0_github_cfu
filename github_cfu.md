<!-- * git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
* git branch -M main
* git push -u origin main - This sends the current version of the project up to the remote repository, and sets the main branch as the default branch to send work up to.
* Git push - pushes changes made to GitHub
* git remote -v - checks the origin(make sure you are the origin and not the other user or your changes will not save. If not working then clone after forking from GitHub)
* git remote remove origin - removes origin from remote
* Git clone - actually enables. Clone to happen
